## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-medical-chatbot.git
cd ai-medical-chatbot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Prepare the FAISS Vector Index

Make sure the file `14.DavidWerner-WhereThereIsNoDoctor.pdf` is in the root directory. Then run:

```bash
python rag.py
```

This creates a folder called `faiss_index/` which holds the searchable vector data.

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file and add your Together AI API key:

```
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
```

---

## 🌐 Make Backend Public with ngrok

### 6. Install ngrok

If you don’t have ngrok installed yet:

* Download it from [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)
* Or install using a package manager:

```bash
brew install ngrok
# or
sudo snap install ngrok
```

### 7. Start the FastAPI Backend

```bash
uvicorn backend:app --port 8000 --reload
```

### 8. Expose the Backend via ngrok

In another terminal:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL from ngrok, such as:

```
Forwarding: https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 9. Update Streamlit to Use ngrok URL

In your `app.py` file, update this line:

```python
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/llm/"
```

To your ngrok HTTPS address:

```python
url = "https://abc123.ngrok.io/llm/"
```

---

## 🔁 Run the Chat UI

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

You can now interact with your medical chatbot.

## 💡 To-Do (Future Improvements)

* [ ] Add persistent chat storage using a database
* [ ] Allow uploading custom medical PDFs
* [ ] Deploy to Render, HuggingFace Spaces, or Docker
* [ ] Integrate voice input/output (speech-to-text and TTS)
* [ ] Expand knowledge base to support more languages and documents
